Part IV Project

Title: Secure Patient Smartphone App which communicates back to Health Care Provider (Doctor)

Outcome: A smart phone application used by a patient that securely communicates back to a Health Care Provider

Description:
OBJECTIVE: To build a smart phone application used by a patient that securely communicates back to a Health Care Provider (doctor / hospital). BUSINESS CASE: By being better able to manage patients, it is expected that they will have improved medical outcomes and require less visits to their Health Care Provider. PATIENT APPLICATION FEATURES: * Remind patients of medications they need to take o View / alter reminders o View medications o Mark as given * Take photos for transmitting to doctor * Add observations / results * Real-time chat with health professional * Monitor vital signs of sick patient for early warnings if they deteriorate HEALTH CARE PROVIDER FEATURES: While the patient is the target application user, the health care provider needs some way to provide the appropriate medications and receive communications back from the patient. The are a number of ways this could be achieved and can be influenced by your interests. A web front end for this would be ideal and give a good mix of technologies, but this could for example also be achieved as a smartphone application.
